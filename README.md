# 🎓 WikiWhiz – Learn Smarter with Wikipedia-Powered Quizzes

Welcome to **WikiWhiz**, your personal trivia companion that transforms Wikipedia content into interactive quizzes! Designed during the **WikiVerse Hackathon** at IIIT-Hyderabad, WikiWhiz makes learning fun, fast, and fact-based — perfect for students, trivia enthusiasts, and lifelong learners.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**WikiWhiz** leverages the vast knowledge base of **Wikipedia APIs** to generate dynamic multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on various topics like science, history, and art. Instead of passively reading articles, users can now *actively engage* with knowledge through gamified quizzes.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

While Wikipedia holds a wealth of educational information, it's mostly consumed passively. There is a lack of engaging, interactive ways for users—especially students—to test and retain what they learn. WikiWhiz aims to change that by offering a trivia platform that taps into Wikipedia's open knowledge network.
